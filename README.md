# Croppy Deals
A produce marketplace to nurture hope and opportunity in communities around the valley.

## Problems we have found in our local farms:
- The San Joaquin Valley is extremely vulnerable to Climate Change and Food Insecurity
- Corporate and Contract Farming has had a negative on our farmers, environment, and citizens
- Food, space, labor, and many other resources are scarce
## To address these issues:
- Break the Barriers that block access to affordable and healthy food
- Connect People with local producers, promoting sustainable farming
- Decrease Emissions, pollutions, and waste coming from distant transportation and packaging
